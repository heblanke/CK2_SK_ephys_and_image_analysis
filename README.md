# VTA_DA_neurons_casein_kinase_2_and_SK_channels-
code for the casein kinase 2 paper 

###
The example directory houses example code workflows and files. They are effectively plug and play. Download the entire directory, confirm your installment of Jupyter notebooks, and run the code. It is entirely self contained, and will output data to your current working directory. These examples are not intended to represent every use case, but as a representation of how Axograph files were analyzed during the writing of the manuscript. 


###
All functions to analyze data are housed in a Jupyter notebook. Code can be run by installing Jupyter and opening the .ipynb file. Code is appropiately commented to indicate when functions work on directories or on single objects. 

###
Axograph files for indiviudal data analysis with their resepective metadata are available upon reasonbable request.
