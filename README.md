# Python code to analyze single cell, patch clamp electrophysiology data collected in Axograph
code for the 3xTg small conductance calcium activated potassium (SK) channel - casein kinase 2 (CK2) study

###
The example directory houses example code workflows and files. They are effectively plug and play. Download the entire directory, confirm your installment of Jupyter notebooks, and run the code within the notebook. It is entirely self contained, and will output data to your current working directory. 

###
These examples are not intended to represent every use case, but as a representation of how Axograph files were analyzed during the writing of the manuscript. 

###
Unfortunately, GitHub has a file size cap at 25MB. Thus, the files in the "spontaneous_firing_example" folder will need to be unzipped prior to analysis. 


###
All functions to analyze data are housed in a Jupyter notebook. Code can be run by installing Jupyter and opening the .ipynb file. Code is appropiately commented to indicate when functions work on directories or on single objects.
